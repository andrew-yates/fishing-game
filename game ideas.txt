Fishing game
Heavily based on me and kris going out in half moon bay
Go fishing. Focus on moving around the ocean in the kayak
Come in for the night. based on amount of fish caught, can get new equipment
day/night cycle and also days of the week + weather
catching a fish in a certain spot adds to your map of that spot
add some reason to keep the kayak moving around



add ons:
Oh also maybe you could be able to go get mussels at some point
description of what you do with the fish
other boats who say stuff to you, friend who also comes out in a boat, competitor boat
wind direction/ weird weather forecasts
some sort of wave splashing graphic if the boat is turning fast
getting the lure stuck on a rock - then have to trace out some amount of rotation of the line
